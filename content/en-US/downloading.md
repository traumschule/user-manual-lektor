# Downloading

The safest and simplest way to download Tor Browser is from the official Tor
Project website at https://www.torproject.org. Your connection to the site
will be secured using [HTTPS](secure-connections.html "Secure Connections"),
which makes it much harder for somebody to tamper with.

However, there may be times when you cannot access the Tor Project website:
for example, it could be blocked on your network. If this happens, you can use
one of the alternative download methods listed below.

## GetTor

GetTor is a service that automatically responds to messages with links to the
latest version of Tor Browser, hosted at a variety of locations, such as
Dropbox, Google Drive and GitHub.

To use GetTor via email:

  1. Send an email to gettor@torproject.org, and in the body of the message simply write “windows”, “osx”, or “linux”, (without quotation marks) depending on your operating system. 

  2. GetTor will respond with an email containing links from which you can download the Tor Browser package, the cryptographic signature (needed for verifying the download), the fingerprint of the key used to make the signature, and the package’s checksum. You may be offered a choice of “32-bit” or “64-bit” software: this depends on the model of the computer you are using. 

To use GetTor via Twitter:

  1. To get links for downloading Tor Browser in English for OS X, send a Direct Message to @get_tor with the words "osx en" in it (you don't need to follow the account). 

To use GetTor via Jabber/XMPP (Jitsi, CoyIM, etc.):

  1. To get links for downloading Tor Browser in Chinese for Linux, send a message to gettor@torproject.org with the words "linux zh" in it. 

## Satori

Satori is an add-on for the Chrome or Chromium browsers that allows you to
download several security and privacy programs from different sources.

To download Tor Browser using Satori:

  1. Install Satori from the Chrome App Store. 

  2. Select Satori from your browser’s Apps menu. 

  3. When Satori opens, click on your preferred language. A menu will open listing the available downloads for that language. Find the entry for Tor Browser under the name of your operating system. Select either “A” or “B” after the name of the program — each one represents a different source from which to get the software. Your download will then begin. 

  4. Wait for your download to finish, then find the “Generate Hash” section in Satori’s menu and click “Select Files”. 

  5. Select the downloaded Tor Browser file. Satori will display the checksum of the file, which you should compare with the software’s original checksum: you can find this by clicking the word “checksum” after the link you clicked on to start the download. If the checksums match, your download was successful, and you can [begin using Tor Browser](first-time.html "Running Tor Browser for the first time"). If they do not match, you may need to try downloading again, or from a different source.
