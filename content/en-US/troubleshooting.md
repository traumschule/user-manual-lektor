# Troubleshooting

You should be able to start browsing the web using Tor Browser shortly after
running the program, and clicking the “Connect” button if you are using it for
the first time.

## Quick fixes

If Tor Browser doesn’t connect, there may be a simple solution. Try each of
the following:

  * Your computer’s system clock must be set correctly, or Tor will not be able to connect. 

  * Make sure another Tor Browser is not already running. If you’re not sure if Tor Browser is running, restart your computer. 

  * Make sure that any antivirus program you have installed is not preventing Tor from running. You may need to consult the documentation for your antivirus software if you do not know how to do this. 

  * Temporarily disable your firewall. 

  * Delete Tor Browser and install it again. If updating, do not just overwrite your previous Tor Browser files; ensure they are fully deleted beforehand. 

## Is your connection censored?

If you still can’t connect, your Internet Service Provider might be censoring
connections to the Tor network. Read the [Circumvention](circumvention.html
"Circumvention") section for possible solutions.
