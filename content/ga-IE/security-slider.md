# Security Slider

Tor Browser includes a “Security Slider” that lets you increase your security
by disabling certain web features that can be used to attack your security and
anonymity. Increasing Tor Browser’s security level will stop some web pages
from functioning properly, so you should weigh your security needs against the
degree of usability you require.

## Accessing the Security Slider
