# Verify

This section is about verifying the signature for your downloaded file.

These instructions apply to Windows, Mac and Linux.

Why you should always verify files after downloading: How do you know that the
Tor program you have is really the one we made? Digital signatures ensure that
the package you are downloading was created by our developers. If the Tor
package has been modified by some attacker it is not safe to use. It doesn't
matter how secure and anonymous Tor is if you're not running the real Tor. For
details see the chapter Why to verify signatures in our verification guide. It
also explains, what digital signatures are and which software you need.
